# **Understanding Compound Interest**

Compound interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This results in “compounding” of the interest, allowing investments or loans to grow faster compared to simple interest.

### **Compound Interest Formula**
The formula for calculating compound interest is:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

where:
- **A** = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
- **P** = the principal investment amount (initial deposit or loan amount)
- **r** = the annual interest rate (decimal)
- **n** = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
- **t** = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

### **Example Calculation**

Suppose you invest ₹10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded quarterly, for a period of 3 years. Let’s calculate the compound interest and the total amount after 3 years.

Given:
- **P** = ₹10,000
- **r** = 5% or 0.05
- **n** = 4 (since the interest is compounded quarterly)
- **t** = 3 years

1. Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
A = 10,000 \times \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{4}\right)^{4 \times 3}
\]

2. Simplify within the brackets:

\[
A = 10,000 \times \left(1 + 0.0125\right)^{12}
\]

3. Calculate the compound factor:

\[
A = 10,000 \times (1.0125)^{12}
\]

4. Using a calculator:

\[
A \approx 10,000 \times 1.1616 = ₹11,616
\]

After 3 years, the total amount will be approximately **₹11,616**.

### **Compound Interest Earned**
To find the compound interest earned, subtract the principal from the total amount:

\[
\text{Compound Interest} = A - P = 11,616 - 10,000 = ₹1,616
\]

So, the compound interest earned over 3 years is **₹1,616**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Compound interest grows faster than simple interest due to interest-on-interest.
- The frequency of compounding (quarterly, monthly, etc.) impacts the total amount.
- Use this formula for investments or loans to estimate growth over time.
